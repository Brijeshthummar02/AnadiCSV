Description:
The header option allows you to specify the names of the columns in your dataset. This is especially helpful in making information readable and user-friendly.
Usage: When you enable this option. The first row of your data is considered the header. and the next row will contain the actual data.

### Skip

Description: The Skip option allows you to skip a number of rows at the beginning of your data series. This is useful for omitting metadata or comments that may precede the actual data.
Usage: Specify the lines that you want to skip. For example, if you set Skip to 2, the first two rows will be ignored when processing the data set.
